# InventoryManager
A mock inventory that can be used as a part of a larger program/game

## How to Run Project
1. Download the .zip file [here](https://github.com/rhysstever/InventoryManager/blob/main/InventoryManager.zip)
2. Extract all the files
3. Run 'InventoryManager.exe'

## Controls
Movement*: WASD or Numpad 8456  
Select*^: E or Numpad 9  
Quit Application: ESC  

*based on the current control scheme. Both work if the control scheme is set to 'Any'  
^selecting currently does nothing (it is designed to be determined in the main program/game the inventory is used in)

## Future Plans
Features I plan to add in the future:  
- wrapping (toggable)
- visually showing when a slot is selected (maybe the red markers turn green)
